🚨 Input Validation & Error Handling

The application includes a robust input validation system to prevent incorrect computations.

Key features:

Automatic detection of invalid or inconsistent inputs

Warning messages displayed when user input does not meet method requirements

For interpolation methods (Newton, Lagrange, Neville), the program checks that:

The number of X values matches the number of Y values


Computations are blocked until valid input is provided


This ensures reliable results and minimizes logical or mathematical errors.
